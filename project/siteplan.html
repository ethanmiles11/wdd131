                <br>-Secondary color: #FF6600; used for hover effects, buttons and key sections
                <br>-Background: #1F1F1F; main background color
                <br>The primary and secondary colors are Rocket League's main colors, and the dark grey provides a sleek modern feel as the background.

            <p>5. Typography: The font to be used is the variable Roboto font. This provides multiple options, styles, weights, etc for a very classic and clean looking font. 
                I will use variations of this font for the site for all elements including headings, body elements, and footer.
