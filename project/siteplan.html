    <!-- 1.) This name is a play on the game's name, Rocket League. The name provides context clues to show that the site will provide a place where 
     users can work on their game and experiment with others. The site is a "Lab" where others can come to learn and study the game, 
     as well as find others to collaborate with.
    2.) Purpose: The site provides a hub for all things Rocket League by providing connections to tournaments, coaching, loadouts, community, and more.
    3.) Scenarios: 
        -Where can I find teammates to play with? I'm tired of solo queuing.
        -What are the best settings to use that will help me improve?
        -Where can I get coaching?
        -How/where do I join tournaments with people my skill level?
    4.) Color Schema:
        -Primary color: #007BFF; used for buttons, active links, and main highlights
        -Secondary color: #FF6600; used for hover effects, buttons and key sections
        -Background: #1F1F1F; main background color
        ! The primary and secondary colors are Rocket League's main colors, and the dark grey provides a sleek modern feel as the background.
    5.) Typography: The font to be used is the variable Roboto font. This provides multiple options, styles, weights, etc for a very classic and clean looking font. 
        I will use variations of this font for the site for all elements including headings, body elements, and footer. -->
